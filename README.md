# check_pulp_local_artifacts


**Disclaimer**: This project scripts are `NOT` delivered and/or released by Red Hat. This is an independent project to help customers and Red Hat Support team to analyze some data, and help with the troubleshooting.

This script will do some queries, just to collect some db/rpm information.

Please, execute this script on your Satellite / Foreman server.

The main idea of this project is to check the packages in the pulpcore database, and the files in the filesystem. For disconnected environment, the number of packages and files in the file system should match.

I'll update the README soon with some additional inforamtion about usage.
